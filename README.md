# Hi :wave:, I'm Martin
---

I'm a versatile professional with a strong background in software development, enterprise architecture, and technology consulting. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to drive innovation and deliver high-quality solutions that meet the needs of clients and users. My expertise spans a wide range of domains, including cloud computing, DevOps, and software engineering, especially in the .NET ecosystem.

Maybe i'm the typical *nerd* who loves to code, but I'm also a team player who enjoys collaborating with others to solve complex problems and achieve common goals. I'm always eager to learn new things and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in the tech industry. My commitment to continuous improvement and professional development has enabled me to grow and succeed in my career.

I'm currently working as an Enterprise Architect at CGI, a leading IT and business consulting firm. In my role as a Director Consulting Services, I help clients transform their business and IT landscapes by designing and implementing innovative solutions that drive digital transformation and business growth. Also part of this role is the responsibility for the development and mentoring my team members to help them reach their full potential. I'm proud that I can support them as a Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT), Instructor for CGI's Risk and Cost Driven Architecture (RCDA), Industry Expert and Technology Evangelist.

In addition to my work at CGI, I'm actively involved in the tech community and contribute to various open-source projects on GitHub.

May I help you with anything? Feel free to reach out to me at [E-Mail](mailto:me@samtrion.net) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-stuehmer/).
